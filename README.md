# Design-Pattern-Template-Method
 
You can write a method that defines a multi-step algorithm(for example: go method).
Then you make this method into a template by allowing subclasses to redefine(override) various steps in this algorithm as needed.
To build a cookie robot,you override  the getParts,assemble,and test methods.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO REWRITE EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH EVERY TIME.
